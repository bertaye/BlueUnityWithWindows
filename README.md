# BlueUnityWithWindows
BlueUnityWithWindows is updated version of the awesome Unity plug-in by https://github.com/bentalebahmed/BlueUnity, I added my C++ Bluetooth API as a Unity Plugin and now users can test their games with Bluetooth in Windows too! This was a must for my personal project, and the code may seem dirty, you can mail me for any recommendations or feedbacks at bertayeren@gmail.com.
